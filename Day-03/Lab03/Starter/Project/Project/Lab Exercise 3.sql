USE TSQL;
GO
select C.contactname, c.country from sales.Customers as C

select distinct C.contactname, c.country from sales.Customers as C

---------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Task 1
-- 
-- Write a SELECT statement to return the contactname and contacttitle columns from the Sales.Customers table, assigning “C” as the table alias. Use the table alias C to prefix the names of the two needed columns in the SELECT list. The benefit of using table aliases will become clearer in future modules when topics such as joins and subqueries will be introduced. 
--
-- Execute the written statement and compare the result that you got with the recommended result shown in the file Lab Exercise 3 - Task 1 Result.txt.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

select * from Sales.Customers as C

select 
	contactname as Person, 
	contacttitle as "Role", 
	city , 
	country, 
	phone as cell 
from Sales.Customers

select e.firstname , e.lastname, e.city, e.hiredate from hr.Employees as e

select 
	e.firstname + ' ' +  	e.lastname as "Full Name", 
	e.city, 
	e.hiredate 
from hr.Employees as e


select 
UPPER(firstname) ,
lower(lastname),
	e.firstname + ' ' +  	e.lastname as "Full Name", 
	e.city, 
	e.hiredate 
from hr.Employees as e


select 
	e.firstname + ' ' +  	e.lastname [Full Name], 
	e.city, 
	e.hiredate 
from hr.Employees e



select * from Stats.Scores

select  from Stats.Scores

-- Task 2
-- 
-- Write a SELECT statement to return the contactname, contacttitle, and companyname columns from the Sales.Customers table. Assign these columns with the aliases Name, Title, and Company Name, respectively, in order to return more human-friendly column titles for reporting purposes.
--
-- Execute the written statement and compare the results that you got with the desired results shown in the file Lab Exercise 3 - Task 2 Result.txt. Notice specifically the titles of the columns in the desired output.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

select c.contactname as "Contact Name", c.contacttitle as " Title", c.companyname as "Company Name"
 
from Sales.Customers as c


---------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Task 3
-- 
-- Write a query to display the productname column from the Production.Products table using “P” as the table alias and “Product Name” as the column alias.
--
-- Execute the written statement and compare the results that you got with the desired results shown in the file Lab Exercise 3 - Task 3 Result.txt.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

select * from Production.products
 
select 
P.productname as "Product Name"
 
from Production.products as P


---------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Task 4
-- 
-- A developer has written a query to retrieve two columns (city and region) from the Sales.Customers table. When the query is executed, it returns only one column. 
--Your task is to analyze the query, correct it to return two columns, 
--and explain why the query returned only one column.
--
-- Execute the query exactly as written inside a query window and observe the result.
--
-- Correct the query to return the city and country columns from the Sales.Customers table.
--
-- Why did the query return only one column? What was the title of the column in the output? 
--What is the best practice when using aliases for columns to avoid such errors?
